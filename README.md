## Experiment 1

Task-1: Perform following operations on image- 
-Image Resizing: Resizing involves changing the dimensions of an image, either by scaling it up or down.
-Image resizing (interpolation methods)
- Linear
- Nearest Neighbors
- Polynomial
- Image Blurring: Blurring is used to reduce image detail, suppress noise, or create artistic effects. Common techniques include:
1. Image blurring
2. Box blurring
3. Gaussian blurring
4. Adaptive blurring

Task-2: Apply Machine Learning Algorithm and find the model accuracy based on K fold Cross Validation with (80-20 train-test split).  
1. Use MNIST dataset

3. Naive Bayesian or its variant.
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) or its variant
5. Decision Trees/ Random Forest.
6. AdaBoost or other ensemble algorithms.
7. Artificial Neural Networks (NN) or its variant.

- Appendix:
About MNIST :-
- The MNIST dataset stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology"
- The dataset contains a large collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
- The dataset was created by re-mixing samples from NIST's original datasets, which were taken from American Census Bureau employees and high school students.
- It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.
- Number of Instances: 70,000 images
- Number of Attributes: 784 (28x28 pixels)
- Target: Column represents the digit (0-9) corresponding to the handwritten image
- Pixel 1-784: Each pixel value (0-255) represents the grayscale intensity of the corresponding pixel in the image.
- The dataset is divided into two main subsets:
- Training Set: Consists of 60,000 images along with their labels, commonly used for training machine learning models.
- Test Set: Contains 10,000 images with their corresponding labels, used for evaluating the performance of trained models.
- Link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset
- Note:- Use sklearn, pyspark, or any other ML library for applying the ML algorithms.
- Load the dataset in sklearn using ‚Äòload_digits‚Äô.
- Load the dataset in pyspark using 'spark.read.csv()‚Äù
